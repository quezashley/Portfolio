    <h2 stlye="text-align: left;"> Intro to Robotics </h2>
     <p> Now, I have a broader view of what constitutes as a robot. Before, I only thought that robots were constructions that moved around and functioned based on what the programmer told them to do. Most of my definition of a robot still remains the same, however, I now see how they don't have to move around to be robots. Also, I now recognize all the day-to-day items that can be considered robots since they carry out a function that they were programmed to do. For example, a car is something I would consider a robot. 
        I am excited about the future of robotics because as their production progresses, they will be able to aid us in our daily life and help us tackle problems. Especially if they become skilled enough to help those out with disabilities of any kind. 
        On the other hand, I am nervous that the introduction of robotics into daily life will end up taking up too much of the work we do, up to the point where humans will no longer know how to work hard for things.

     <p> I liked working in groups because it was easier to solve problems, since you had more minds and perspectives working on the problem. However, I feel like I could improve the group work because although everybody had a say in how to fix the problems, sometimes some people ended up taking over and doing the majority of the work. </p>  
    <h2 stlye="text-align: left;"> Intro to Robotics - Blinking LED's> </h2>
     <p> Our team worked together on the blinking LED's by planning what we wanted to program the lights to do and to what song. Then we each had a go at the coding, on our own, but asking each other questions when we needed help. Also, when one of us had already figured out a part that the other hadn't, we would show and teach it to the other. However, I guess the group work could have improved if we worked on the code together the whole time. </p>
