    <h3 stlye="text-align: left;"> Intro to Robotics </h3>
     <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> Before, I only thought that robots were items that moved around and functioned based on what they were programmed to do. Most of my definition of a robot still remains, but I now see how they don't have to move around to be robots, and a lot of day-to-day items can be considered robots.</p> 
     <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> I am excited about the future of robotics because as their production progresses, they will be able to help us tackle problems. On the other hand, I am nervous that the introduction to daily life will end up taking up too much of the work we do, up to the point where humans will no longer know how to work hard for things. </p>
     </p>
     <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> I liked working in groups because it was easier to solve problems, since you had more minds and perspectives working on the problem. However, I feel like I could improve the group work because although everybody had a say in how to fix the problems, sometimes some people ended up taking over and doing the majority of the work. </p>  
    <h3 stlye="text-align: left;"> Intro to Robotics - Blinking LED's </h3>
     <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> Our team worked together on the blinking LED's by planning what we wanted to program the lights to do and to what song. Then we each had a go at the coding, on our own, but asking each other questions when we needed help. Also, when one of us had already figured out a part that the other hadn't, we would show and teach it to the other. However, I guess the group work could have improved if we worked on the code together the whole time. </p>
     <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are: </p>
     <pre style="text-align:center;"> void setup()  {
 
}

void loop()     {

}
   
    </pre>
    
   <h3 stlye="text-align: left;"> Intro to Robotics - Dance Party </h3>
    <p stlye="font-family:calibri;"> I learned that circuits are really difficult to construct and have them do what you program them to do, if you are not specific enough. Also, that you can use circuits to light up LED's and make sevrvos move when you want them to. </p>
