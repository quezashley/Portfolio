    <h2 stlye="color:rgb(255,163,0); text-align: left;"> Ashley Quezada </h2>
    <p> I am fifteen years old. Both of my parents are from Jalisco, Mexico, but my sister and I were born in California. I was born in San Pablo and currently still live there. This upcoming year, I will be entering the eleventh grade at Making Waves Academy. My favorite subject in school is math, and I wish to pursue a career involving that when I get older. I enjoy watching movies and TV shows when I stay in for the day, but I also enjoy going out with my friends. My favorite thing to do on a weekend is to get dressed up and go to <i> bailes </i>, especially after it's been a while since I had gone to one. I also relly like listening to all types of music, except country, and am open to trying anything.   </p>
